## Microscopic Models

### Social Force

**Title**: Social Force Model for Pedestrian Dynamics  

**Authors**: Dirk Helbing, Péter Molnár  

**Publication Year**: 1995  

**Summary**: The Social Force Model (SFM) models each pedestrian as a particle driven by internal "social forces": (1) a driving force toward a desired velocity, (2) repulsive forces from other pedestrians and obstacles, and (3) attractive forces (e.g., groups or points of interest). The coupled nonlinear Langevin-like equations reproduce self-organization phenomena such as lane formation, oscillations at bottlenecks, and stop-and-go waves.

**Link**: [DOI:10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282)  

**Datasets**: Custom corridor experiments, Pedestrian Dynamics Data Archive (PDDA). 

**Metrics**: Flow rates, lane formation patterns, velocity-density curves.  

**Applications**: Evacuation planning, urban crowd management, architectural design. 

**Limitations**: Original formulation assumes isotropic interactions and can produce unrealistic lateral oscillations or collisions at high densities; parameters require calibration; lacks explicit anticipation/heading.  

**Future Directions**: Incorporate heading/orientation, vision-based perception, collision anticipation, heterogeneity in agent properties, and calibration against real-world trajectory datasets.

**Title**:  Walking Ahead: The Headed Social Force Model

**Authors**:  Francesco Farina, Daniele Fontanelli, Andrea Garulli, Antonio Giannitrapani, Domenico Prattichizzo

**Publication Year**: 2017

**Summary**: This paper extends the SFM by adding explicit pedestrian heading (orientation) and a unicycle-like dynamic so agents predominantly move forward. The Headed Social Force Model reduces unrealistic lateral motion found in the classical SFM and introduces group-cohesion terms. Simulations show smoother, more realistic trajectories and improved handling of dense flows.
