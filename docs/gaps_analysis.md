# The Five Critical Gaps: Evidence-Based Analysis

## **Gap #1: Limited Behavioral Diversity Crisis**

<div align="center">

### The Research Reality

```
Current Model Assumptions:          Research Findings Show:
┌─────────────────────┐            ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Rational behavior   │     VS     │   Context-dependent │
│ Rule compliance     │            │   Social influences │
│ Predictable paths   │            │  Cultural variations│
└─────────────────────┘            └─────────────────────┘
```

</div>

**Research Evidence**: The integration of autonomous vehicles into public roads presents profound implications for pedestrian safety, influenced by the variability of pedestrian behaviors and the absence of traditional communication mechanisms, such as eye contact and gestures, commonly relied upon in human-driven scenarios.

### **Current Research Status**

Recent work focuses on learning pedestrian social interactions, but existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions.

**Key Research Gaps Identified:**
- Limited representation of non-compliant behaviors
- Insufficient cultural context modeling
- Absence of emotional state considerations
- Lack of communication mechanism simulation

---

## **Gap #2: Incomplete Scenario Coverage**

**Research Evidence**: Current simulation environments fall behind on two fronts -- the background vehicles fail to simulate naturalistic driving behavior and the existing environments do not test the entire pipeline in a modular fashion.

### **Scenario Testing Limitations**

Simulation of pedestrian motion in urban traffic networks faces challenges in mixed traffic systems with complex interactions.

**Verified Missing Elements:**
- Complex weather condition modeling
- Event-driven crowd behavior scenarios
- Construction and temporary infrastructure changes
- Multi-modal transportation interactions

**Industry Impact**: The need for complex and naturalistic traffic environments that could emulate the complexities of the external environment while providing realistic sensor outputs to the AV pipeline.

---

## **Gap #3: Static Intent Modeling Paradox**

<div align="center">

### The Dynamic Intent Challenge

```
Research Finding: Pedestrians change intentions dynamically
Current Models: Static intent prediction at observation start
Required Solution: Continuous real-time intent tracking
```

</div>

**Research Evidence**: Current approaches lack the capability to estimate temporal-dynamic intent changes of pedestrians and provide explanations of interaction scenes.

### **Intent Prediction Research Status**

Recent research indicates that longer observation sequences positively impact overall accuracy, with observation lengths providing additional cues to infer pedestrian actions.

**Key Research Findings:**
- Observation windows of 2 seconds may be sufficient to differentiate crossing from non-crossing actions
- Need for real-time adaptation to intention changes
- Importance of explanatory models for interaction understanding

---

## **Gap #4: Social Intelligence Deficit**

<div align="center">

### The Human Social Network

```
          Eye Contact ←→ Gestures
               ↕         ↕
    Group Dynamics ←→ Cultural Norms
               ↕         ↕  
         Body Language ←→ Verbal Cues
                    ↕
               AV Navigation
                    ↕
           Integration Challenge
```

</div>

**Research Evidence**: Pedestrian trajectory prediction remains a challenge for autonomous systems, particularly due to the intricate dynamics of social interactions.

### **Social Intelligence Research Gap**

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene.

**Current Research Focus:**
- Social interaction learning with generative adversarial networks
- Attention mechanisms for social context modeling
- Integration of non-verbal communication understanding

---

## **Gap #5: Dataset Limitations Dilemma**

<div align="center">

### Current Dataset Landscape

</div>

**Research Evidence**: Many methods still revolve around well-established trajectory prediction benchmarks such as ETH/UCY and SDD, which primarily contain pedestrians in non-traffic settings.

### **Dataset Coverage Analysis**

<table>
<tr>
<th>Dataset Category</th>
<th>Examples</th>
<th>Coverage</th>
<th>AV Relevance</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Pedestrian-Only</b></td>
<td>ETH/UCY, Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD)</td>
<td>Non-traffic environments</td>
<td> Limited</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Urban Traffic</b></td>
<td>Argoverse 2, nuScenes, Waymo Open Motion</td>
<td>Real-world AV scenarios</td>
<td> High</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Key Research Finding**: Although specialized datasets such as Argoverse 2 or nuScenes address this shortcoming, they are rarely utilized in pedestrian research due to their primary focus on vehicles or all road users combined.
