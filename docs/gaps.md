## Overview of Gaps

Pedestrian simulation models for AV usage face several limitations when applied to industry contexts. These gaps stem from dataset limitations, model assumptions, and the lack of tailored frameworks for specific industries. Below, we categorize the validated gaps based on recent research findings.

| Gap Category | Description | Affected Industries | Impact on AV Usage | Research Evidence |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Limited Behavioral Diversity** | Models focus primarily on compliant pedestrian behaviors, neglecting unpredictable or risky actions | Automotive, Public Safety | Underestimates collision risks in dynamic environments | Absence of traditional communication mechanisms in AV-pedestrian interactions |
| **Incomplete Scenario Coverage** | Simulations lack complex scenarios such as mixed traffic conditions and varied environmental factors | Urban Planning, Logistics | Fails to test AV robustness in real-world conditions | Complex interactions in mixed traffic systems |
| **Static Intent Modeling** | Models struggle with dynamic pedestrian intention changes and temporal behavior prediction | Automotive, Public Safety | Delays AV decision-making and reduces safety margins | Lack of benchmark labels for temporal-dynamic intent changes |
| **Insufficient Social Intelligence** | Limited capability to model social interactions and contextual understanding | All Industries | Reduces AV acceptance and social integration | Need for social capabilities in autonomous vehicles |
| **Dataset Limitations** | Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage of diverse scenarios and behaviors | Research & Development | Limits model generalization and real-world applicability | Challenges in precisely forecasting pedestrian trajectories |

## Detailed Analysis of Gaps

### 1. Limited Behavioral Diversity

**Description**: Current pedestrian simulation models primarily focus on compliant behaviors, neglecting the variability of pedestrian behaviors and the absence of traditional communication mechanisms such as eye contact and gestures commonly relied upon in human-driven scenarios.

**Affected Industries**:
- **Automotive**: AVs must handle unpredictable pedestrian behaviors to ensure safety
- **Public Safety**: Emergency response vehicles need models for various behavioral patterns

**Impact on AV Usage**: Models that don't account for behavioral diversity may lead to inadequate safety measures and reduced public acceptance of AV technology.

**Research Evidence**: The integration of autonomous vehicles into public roads presents profound implications for pedestrian safety, influenced by the variability of pedestrian behaviors.

### 2. Incomplete Scenario Coverage

**Description**: Simulation of pedestrian motion in urban traffic networks faces challenges in mixed traffic systems with complex interactions.

**Affected Industries**:
- **Urban Planning**: Requires comprehensive models for diverse urban environments
- **Logistics**: Needs simulation capabilities for various operational scenarios

**Impact on AV Usage**: Limited scenario coverage reduces the robustness of AV systems when deployed in real-world conditions.

### 3. Static Intent Modeling

**Description**: Current approaches lack the capability to estimate temporal-dynamic intent changes of pedestrians and provide explanations of interaction scenes.

**Affected Industries**:
- **Automotive**: Real-time intent prediction is crucial for safe navigation
- **Public Safety**: Dynamic intent understanding is essential for emergency scenarios

**Impact on AV Usage**: Static models limit the ability of AVs to predict and respond to changing pedestrian intentions effectively.

**Research Evidence**: The PSI dataset addresses dynamic intent changes for pedestrians to cross in front of ego-vehicles, achieved from 24 drivers with diverse backgrounds.

### 4. Insufficient Social Intelligence

**Description**: Future autonomous cars need to fit into mixed conditions with not only technical but also social capabilities.

**Affected Industries**: All industries deploying AVs in public spaces

**Impact on AV Usage**: Lack of social intelligence capabilities may lead to awkward or unsafe interactions between AVs and pedestrians.

### 5. Dataset Limitations

**Description**: Current challenges in pedestrian trajectory prediction include the need for precisely forecasting surrounding pedestrians' future trajectories to assist intelligent agents in achieving better motion planning.

**Affected Industries**: Research institutions and AV developers across all sectors

**Impact on AV Usage**: Limited datasets restrict the development and validation of robust pedestrian behavior models.
